# Nutanix PHP API Lab v3 - Complete Demo

This Laravel 8 demo app is designed as a complete working version of the dashboard created in the [Nutanix PHP 7.4 and Laravel 8 lab](https://www.nutanix.dev/labs/php-7-4-laravel-8-api-lab/).

Rather than download this complete app and run it standalone, new users are recommended to follow the lab so that all components and concepts are appropriately communicated.

Those with Laravel experience are welcome to download this demo and use as they see fit, of course.
